# KC-Proteomics

This is an ideation and brainstorming repository for this project, as well as a repository
serving as a template structure for other repositories.

## Template Info

At a high level, repository structure is as follows:

1. `docs/` contains the documentation for the repository
2. `src/` contains the source code of the repository
3. `tests/` contains unit or regression tests to ensure source code functionality

Other files, like build scripts, installation scripts, build tool files e.g. makefiles, will be
in the root directory. Other directories, like `lib/` or `include/` for language specific applications
can be added, but are not a part of the template.
